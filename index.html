      <p>Hi! My name's Brandon and I am a regular 26 year old trying to figure out how to become a programmer! I graduated from The University of Arizona with a Bachelors in Marketing and I am currently working in the marketing field for my parents business. I hope to one day, after learning how to code, focus on the technical side of marketing.</p>

      <p>I grew up traveling quite a bit as my father is a pilot. I have lived in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and visited many unique and interesting places in my lifetime. I love to play and watch sports as well as play video games in my free time. I love my family, especially my little nephew pictured above! I am excited to pursue a career in web development and put the skills I have learned in this program to good use!</p>
